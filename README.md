# MusicStore
In this project we had to develop an online e-commerce site that sells music and other products. We implemented several technologies but mainly stuck to the Spring MVC framework. The technologies we used are:

-	Spring Boot: Using the MVC framework to quickly build views, enetites, and business logic to have a complete web app
-	MySQL: we used this relational database to persist our data and create joins
-	Spring JPA: We used this as an abstraction and to create our entities quickly without writing SQL queries 
-	JSP: We used servlet pages to create our views we used bootstrap to quickly create components that were reusable and robust

The site consists of a home screen that allows users to view products without logging in and add products to their cart if they are logged in. Users can also search for a product using a product name and remove items from the cart. The user can then purchase products from the cart by entering their credit card information.

To plan for this project we created short 1 day sprints to quickly and effectively finish and have attainable MVP goals.
-	Day 1 :Planning (user stories/entity diagram/wireframe)
-	Day 2: Creating a database, Using Spring initializer we started the Spring Boot project, connected our database and created entities.
